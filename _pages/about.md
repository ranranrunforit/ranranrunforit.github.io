## My Passion as Coder

>"There are a lot of negative things in the world, there’s a lot of terrible things that are happening all over the world all the time.
>There are lots of problems that needs to get solved. Lots of things are miserable and can get you down.

## Some things about me

>"I believe there’s a tradeoff between looking smart and being right."

>"I love working with people who are iterating quickly, making mistakes, learning from those mistakes, and trying again and again."

>"I resonate with people who are trying and failing.
>Failure and willingness to look stupid—these are essential ingredients."

I love learning new things, therefore I had worked on large set of fields. I love creating new things and find solutions to real life problems. I am passionate to solve problems using novel ideas and iterate quickly on my ideas to optimize it for scalability.

I also improve myself everyday, optimizing my work flow in every step of my life. I like things clean and organized.

And I am fun to be with :D
