- Conduct a simulation study to illustrate the factors influencing statistical power in linear regression.
- Investigate the impact of sample size, signal strength, and noise level on statistical power.
- Visualize and explain the effects of these factors on statistical power.
- Examine the significance of regression test and its implications.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of using Test RMSE for selecting the "best" model.
