- Develop linear regression and tree-based models for housing price prediction.
- Compare the effectiveness of L1-norm penalty (Lasso), L2-norm penalty (Ridge), and Elastic Net regularization methods for linear regression.
- Apply data pre-processing techniques such as one-hot encoding and Winsorization.
