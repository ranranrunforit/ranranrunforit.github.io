## AutoGen Core

Something a little different.

This is agnostic to the underlying Agent framework

You can use AutoGen AgentChat, or you can use something else; it's an Agent interaction framework.

From that point of view, it's positioned similarly to LangGraph.

### The fundamental principle

Autogen Core decouples an agent's logic from how messages are delivered.  
The framework provides a communication infrastructure, along with agent lifecycle, and the agents are responsible for their own work.

The communication infrastructure is called a Runtime.

There are 2 types: **Standalone** and **Distributed**.
