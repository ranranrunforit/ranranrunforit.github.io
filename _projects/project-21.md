AI agent tools have exploded and most people are still guessing what to use when. 

If you're building anything beyond a demo, the tool you choose matters early.

Hereâ€™s a clear breakdown, depending on what youâ€™re building.

- **If you need to chain tools and memory across steps â†’ LangChain**

Still the most flexible for logic-first workflows.
But the learning curve is real if youâ€™re not used to designing agent state.

- **If youâ€™re building teams of agents that pass tasks â†’ CrewAI**

Roles, memory and handoff logic baked in.
It works when you need structure, not just clever prompts.

- **If your agent needs to ask, refine, repeat â†’ AutoGen**

Great for tasks that evolve through feedback.
The agent learns more by asking than assuming.

- **If you want agents to behave like real dev teams â†’ MetaGPT**

You define a spec, and the PM, Dev, QA agents execute.
Useful when you need product thinking, not just code output.

- **If your task needs retries, state or conditional flows â†’ LangGraph**

This saved us time debugging long workflows.
Visual graphs help you spot logic loops fast.

- **If your agent is in production and failing silently â†’ AgentOps**

Dashboards, logs, alerts.
 
- **If youâ€™re prototyping fast with your own APIs â†’ Superagent**

Open-source, vector DB, memory-ready.
Easy to fork and test something new in under an hour.
 
- **If youâ€™re doing RAG with large docs or search flows â†’ Haystack Agents**

Dev-centric, tuned for retrieval pipelines.
Itâ€™s modular, and itâ€™s built to go deep into documents, not wide.
